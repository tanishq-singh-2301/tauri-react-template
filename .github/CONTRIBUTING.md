You deserve to add your details to the [list of contributors](https://github.com/tanishq-singh-2301/tauri-react-template/blob/main/package.json#L7).

### Add a new public method

The API tries to be as fluent as possible.
Feel free to create a [new issue](https://github.com/tanishq-singh-2301/tauri-react-template/issues/new) to gather feedback on a potential API change.

### Remove an existing public method

A method to be removed should be deprecated in the next major version then removed in the following major version.

By way of example, the `something()` method present in v1.0.0 was deprecated in v1.0.1 and removed in v1.0.2.
